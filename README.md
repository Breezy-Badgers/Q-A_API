# Q-A_API
# ShopBox Questions and Answers API Documentation


The goal of this project was to design a system that can at least handle 100 requests per second across 8 endpoints to serve a Questions and Answers component for an e-commerce application. 

Data to be the generated came from 3 csv's with millions of records. The provided csv's were one containing questions, answers, photos related to specific answer. Due to handle the relational nature of the provided data, Neo4J was selected as the database. 

A Cloud Architecture was created on AWS EC2, with Express server containerized with Docker, Neo4J, and Custom built load balancer to horizontally scale the application. With the architecture in place, the api could handle 1000 requests per second with two servers running.
